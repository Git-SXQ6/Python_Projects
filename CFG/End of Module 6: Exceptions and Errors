# Use a try-except block to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric values.

# If the input is invalid, show a descriptive error message.

# Define a custom exception called InvalidLength for an invalid song length.

# Raise your custom exception if the song length entered is a negative number.

# If the user has entered a valid song length, calculate this length in minutes and display the result to the user.
